# merge-pass

This library allows you to easily run a combination of post-processing
effects on an image, canvas or existing texture. It does so by generating
shaders to apply the effect in as few passes as possible.

Right now, this package is in pre-alpha. If you have tried using this library
and have an idea of how to improve it, let me know!

## Live Example

This [live example](https://www.bandaloo.fun/merge-pass/example.html) shows multiple
demos that with code samples. This shows off the variety of effects you can create
with this library.

## Usage Example

This [usage example](https://github.com/bandaloo/merge-pass-usage) will show
you how to get started with using 2D images such as canvases and videos. This
[other example](https://github.com/bandaloo/one-context-merge-pass) shows you
how to use this library with only a single WebGL2 rendering context and textures
instead of images.

## Package

Here is the [package on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bandaloo/merge-pass).

## Development

Run `npm run build` and `npm run bundle` to create the compiled
`dist/index.js`. Alternatively, you could run `npm run buildwatch` and
`npm run bundlewatch` in separate sessions to get live updates. To build the
docs, run `npm run docs` and run a local server that serves everything in the
`docs` folder.

## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to Charlie Roberts for offering feedback on the design of
this API and by helping bug test by integrating this library into the
[marching.js](https://github.com/charlieroberts/marching) online playground.
