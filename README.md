Right now, this package is in pre-alpha so I wouldn't recommend using it for
anything big yet. However, if you want to try it out, you are more than
welcome. Also, if you have any ideas for post-processing effects you would
like to see included in the library, please let me know!

This library allows you to easily run a combination of post-processing
effects on an image or canvas. It does so by generating shaders to apply the
effect in as few passes as possible.
